## ðŸ’» Installation 

Make sure you are using Python 3.11 when installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` as at the time of writing,
all dependencies support Python 3.11. 
If you use later versions of Python, you may face issues with installing the required depencenies if you would like to follow along with the book.

I've tested the dependency installation on both Mac and PC (Windows 11).

> If any of the package installations failed due to dependency conflicts, remove the explicit package versions from `requriements.txt` file to let your package manager resolve dependency versions.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

At the start of each chapter, checkout the relevant start branch to follow along with the code examples as you develop the application.
For instance, at the start of chapter 2 checkout the `ch02-starter` branch. 

If you get stuck or want to view the repository state at the end of each chapter, you can checkout the corresponding `chxx-end` branch.

> Branches have not been implemented yet and will be available near the publication time.
