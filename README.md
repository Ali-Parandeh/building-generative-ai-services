## Installation 

Make sure you are using Python 3.11 when installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` as at the time of writing,
all dependencies support Python 3.11. 
If you use later versions of Python, you may face issues with installing the required depencenies if you would like to follow along with the book.

I've tested the dependency installation on both Mac and PC (Windows 11).

> If any of the package installations failed due to dependency conflicts, remove the explicit package versions from `requriements.txt` file to let your package manager resolve dependency versions.
